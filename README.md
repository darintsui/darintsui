### Hi there 👋

My name is Darin. It's a pleasure to meet you! 

* You can view my [CV](https://darintsui.github.io/assets/pdf/DarinTsui_CV.pdf) here.
* You can view my [resume](https://darintsui.github.io/assets/pdf/DarinTsui_Resume.pdf) here.
* For more information, check out my website [here](https://darintsui.github.io/)! 

## About
I’m a Ph.D. student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I previously received my BS degree at the University of California San Diego in Bioengineering. I am currently working on developing artificial intelligence solutions in applications of bioinformatics with Dr. <a href="https://amirmohan.github.io/">Amirali Aghazadeh</a>. In my undergrad, I was designing a low-cost surgical navigation platform using computer vision under Dr. Frank Talke in the <a href="https://www.talkelab.ucsd.edu/">Talke Biomedical Device Lab</a>. I have also explored applications of machine learning in bioelectronic COVID-19 detection under Dr. Gert Cauwenberghs in the <a href="https://isn.ucsd.edu/index.php">Integrated Systems Neuroengineering Laboratory</a>.

* 💓 I code everything I do in Python and MATLAB.
* 🌱 I’m currently exploring deep learning in bioinformatics. 
    * Also (trying to) learn R and SQL on the side.
* ⚡ Fun fact: I started uni as a mechanical engineer! 
* 💬 Ask me about anything! If I don't know it, I'd love to learn.
* 📫 Want to get in contact? Shoot me an email at <dtsui@ieee.org>
