### Hi there 👋

My name is Darin. It's a pleasure to meet you! 

## About
I am a senior Bioengineering undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego. My research focuses on machine learning and artifical intelligence in applications of healthcare. I currently research under Dr. Frank Talke in the [Talke Biomedical Device Lab](https://www.talkelab.ucsd.edu/) developing a surgical positioning platform for minimally invasive surgery. Concurrently, I also conduct research with Dr. Tzyy-Ping Jung at the [Swartz Center of Computational Neuroscience](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/) exploring transient changes in stress using EEG. 

* 💓 I code everything I do in Python and MATLAB.
* 🌱 I’m currently exploring deep learning in MRI thresholding and imaging. 
    * Also (trying to) learn C++ on the side.
* ⚡ Fun fact: I started uni as a mechanical engineer! 
* 💬 Ask me about anything! If I don't know it, I'd love to learn.
* 📫 Want to get in contact? Shoot me an email at <dtsui@ieee.org>
