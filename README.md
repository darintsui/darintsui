### Hi there üëã

My name is Darin. It's a pleasure to meet you! 

* You can view my [CV](https://darintsui.github.io/assets/pdfs/DarinTsui_CV.pdf) here.
* You can view my [resume](https://darintsui.github.io/uploads/DarinTsui_Resume.pdf) here.

## About
I am a senior Bioengineering undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego. My research focuses on machine learning and artifical intelligence in applications of healthcare. I currently research under Dr. Frank Talke in the [Talke Biomedical Device Lab](https://www.talkelab.ucsd.edu/) developing a surgical positioning platform for minimally invasive surgery. Concurrently, I also am exploring applications of machine learning in bioelectronic COVID-19 detection under Dr. Gert Cauwenberghs in the [Integrated Systems Neuroengineering Laboratory](https://isn.ucsd.edu/index.php).

* üíì I code everything I do in Python and MATLAB.
* üå± I‚Äôm currently exploring deep learning in MRI thresholding and imaging. 
    * Also (trying to) learn C++ on the side.
* ‚ö° Fun fact: I started uni as a mechanical engineer! 
* üí¨ Ask me about anything! If I don't know it, I'd love to learn.
* üì´ Want to get in contact? Shoot me an email at <dtsui@ieee.org>
