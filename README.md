### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Darin. It's a pleasure to meet you!

## About
Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate and NSF GRFP fellow at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Bioengineering. I previously received my BS degree at the University of California San Diego in Bioengineering. I currently work with Dr. Amirali Aghazadeh in the <a href="https://amirmohan.github.io/">AI ML & Information Group</a>, where I develop scalable, interpretable tools for generative models in the biosciences. I am currently supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. My research focuses on:

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I previously received my BS degree at the University of California San Diego in Bioengineering. I am currently working on developing artificial intelligence solutions in applications of bioinformatics with Dr. <a href="https://amirmohan.github.io/">Amirali Aghazadeh</a>. In my undergrad, I was designing a low-cost surgical navigation platform using computer vision under Dr. Frank Talke in the <a href="https://www.talkelab.ucsd.edu/">Talke Biomedical Device Lab</a>. I have also explored applications of machine learning in bioelectronic COVID-19 detection under Dr. Gert Cauwenberghs in the <a href="https://isn.ucsd.edu/index.php">Integrated Systems Neuroengineering Laboratory</a>.

* ðŸ’“ I code everything I do in Python and MATLAB.
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring deep learning in bioinformatics. 
* âš¡ Fun fact: I started uni as a mechanical engineer! 
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! If I don't know it, I'd love to learn.
* ðŸ“« Want to get in contact? Shoot me an email at <darint@gatech.edu>

My background is highlighly interdisciplinary. I previously validated deep learning models at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/surgalign/">Surgalign</a> (acquired by Xtant Medical), developed an optical surgical platform in the <a href="https://www.talkelab.ucsd.edu/">Talke Biomedical Device Lab</a>, and designed a bioelectronic COVID-19 test in the <a href="https://isn.ucsd.edu/index.php">Integrated Systems Neuroengineering Laboratory</a>.
